# Portfolio Projects

The projects within this repository were developed as part of my own personal training. Each script contains expertise I have gathered that would ultimatley showcase my abilities within each language and that I can hopefully replicate in future work/projects.


Here is a summary of the different techniques used per Project:

Covid Portfolio Project Script.sql:
- Basic Query Structure
- Data Aggregation
- Data Comparison
- Value Type Conversion
- Common Table Expression (CTE)
- Temp Table
- Reconciliation of Null Values
- Creating Views

Data Cleaning.sql:
- Standardizing Date Format
- Breaking down values to multiple columns (i.e. Address)
- Altering Table
- Search and Replace Values
- Removing duplicates
- Deleting unused columns
